outline of what whispr.dev does

whispr.dev is a software developmen company owned by the folks behind whisprer.

a general purpose dev. co. it's the place any non-specialist or otherwise homless projects reside - other people might use a folder labelled 'misc.'
currently all that lives here is:
- GotGirl: a now abandoned project that had originally intended to democratise, bring safety and fairness to certain aspects of the adult entertainment industry with future scope to expand into a more general blockchain based lockbox/filetransfer/marketplace enterprise.
- LongDistance Never Works: an active project based around LoRaWAN technology, mostly for educational purposes as much as anything.
